Projects can be organized first into one of two categories: having to do with getting more MIT courses up online, or being unrelated to that. The former category can be further broken down into one of (1) recruitment, (2) collection, or (3) processing. Below we mention some of our main projects.  

* Building specialized tools to speed up video editing and copyright/IP handling for courses, allowing us to massively increase throughput of course publication
* SOUL notetaker program: we hire students or additional TAs to create open education resources (e.g. lecture notes, recitation notes, improved homework solutions, curated questions-and-answers, …). This is particularly important for classes in which the professor does not want their lecture video online but is ok with a textbook-like scribed version of their lecture going up online.
* Innovating technologies and workflows to record lectures, packaging these into easy-to-use solutions with good documentation, training TAs on these workflows, and providing guides to professors on the various recording options they have.
* Blogposts, interviews, and podcasts to share our thoughts and what we’ve learned with the world and start conversations with people.
* Figuring out what’s missing from online open education learning materials (on OCW, and elsewhere), and recruiting MIT classes to put online to fill those gaps.
* Surveys, e.g. a survey of students to understand how lecture recordings help/hurt them, to help inform how MIT builds out more recording infrastructure.
* Creating better expectations and incentives for people to contribute to OER by creating awards for students/TAs/profs, sending out newsletters to profs per semester that detail the impact they are having, etc.
* Experimenting new ways to teach laboratory classes and discussion-based classes for online students.
* A reading group that meets every two weeks, open to the entire community -- a space for people to brainstorm, network, and hopefully create concrete blogposts, projects, or experiments from the discussions that happen
* Interviewing students, administrators, and professors at universities (and also others like employers) and using what we learn to inform the design of open education materials.
* And a few more!
