title: Students for Open and Universal Learning
---

SOUL (students for open and universal learning) is an organization that works to accelerate, experiment with, and build a stronger culture of open education at MIT and beyond. We want to build a future where anyone can learn anything from anywhere for free or at low-cost.

Our main goal for the 2022-2023 academic year is to
1. open source as many MIT classes as possible such that they are realistically learnable -- with complete materials such as lecture videos, lecture notes, homework and homework solutions, Q/A, and more, and
2. do this while prioritizing quality over quantity: focusing on building solid infrastructure and workflows to scale up high-quality production in future semesters.

SOUL aims to push the boundaries of what open education materials look like through systematic experimentation while keeping in mind that technology alone [cannot](https://failuretodisrupt.com/) transform education.

This site is under development. Check back at the end of January when we will have several courses on here.
