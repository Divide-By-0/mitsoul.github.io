### Students for Open and Universal Learning

- We think of all people as lifelong learners @ _**students**_

- We want all learning resources to be accessible to everyone @ _**open**_

- We need resources to be "realistically learnable from" for people with different academic backgrounds, we need to make an intentional effort to make sure everyone has the opportunity to learn from these resources, and we want to be able to learn anything @ _**universal**_

- We're all about learning @ _**learning**_

- We wanted a nice acronym @ _**SOUL**_
