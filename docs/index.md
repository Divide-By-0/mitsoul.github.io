title: Students for Open and Universal Learning
---

SOUL (students for open and universal learning) is an organization that works to accelerate, experiment with, and build a stronger culture of open education at MIT and beyond. We want to live in a world where anyone can learn anything from anywhere for free or at low-cost. To that end, we are working on pushing the boundaries of what open education materials look like through various [projects](/projects/).

Anyone trying to innovate in the education space should be wary of overpromising and should acknowledge that the situation is probably more complicated than they realize. We are doing our best to be mindful of the [limits](https://failuretodisrupt.com/) of technology in disrupting education. Our approach involves systematic experimentation and, at every step, actually talking to and working with all kinds of students, teachers, and administrators to make sure what we are building is sensible.

Our main goal for the 2022-2023 academic year is to
1. open source as many MIT classes as possible such that they are realistically learnable, with complete materials such as lecture videos, lecture notes, homework, homework solutions, Q/A, and more, and
2. do this while prioritizing quality over quantity, focusing on building solid infrastructure and workflows to scale up high-quality production in future semesters.

This website is under development. Check back at the end of January when we will have several courses on here, more information about each of our projects, and some sort of manifesto that provides a more formal analysis of our vision.
