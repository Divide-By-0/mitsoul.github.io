    <p>
      SOUL works to accelerate, experiment with, and build a stronger culture of open education at MIT. We work on many diverse open education projects. Our main focus is to 100x the number of classes that MIT puts online for free for anyone in the world to learn from, and to do so in a way so that each class is realistically learnable. We want to push the boundaries of what open education materials look like at MIT and beyond.
